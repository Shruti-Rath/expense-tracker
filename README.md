# Expense Tracker (React)
It is a web application ,that allows users to track manage their daily expenses..
# It includes features like :-
1. Add new expenses where Users can input details like the name of the expense,amount & a category..
2. A dashboard or section summarizing the total expenses for the month or year, breaking them down by category..
3. Users can edit or delete expenses to keep their records accurate..
### For a more robust solution we can also implement a backend server for ex- Node.js/Express/MongoDB for saving,retrieving and managing expense data..
